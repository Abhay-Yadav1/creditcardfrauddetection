💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Project 🔍



📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions (highly imbalanced dataset). The features are numerical and have been transformed using PCA for confidentiality.

🚀 Features
Data Analysis: Explores the dataset to understand its structure and imbalance.
Visualization: Uses plots to visualize transaction patterns and fraud cases.
Model Training: Implements machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

🔧 Technologies Used
- Python🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib📊
- Seaborn 🌈
- Scikit-learn 🤖

📈 Key Steps
1. Data Loading & Exploration 
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Check for missing values and data imbalance.

2. Data Visualization
   - Plot distributions of transaction amounts and times.
   - Visualize fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.

3. Feature Engineering  
   - Normalize/scale features if needed.
   - Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.

4. Model Training  
   - Train models like  Random Forest, or XGBoost.
   - Focus on metrics like precision and recall due to imbalance.

5. Evaluation  
   - Use classification report.
   - Optimize models for fraud detection.

🎯 Results
- Achieved high recall to catch as many fraud cases as possible.
- Balanced precision and recall to minimize false positives.
